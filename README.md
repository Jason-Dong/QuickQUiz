Quick Quiz Generator

The Quick Quiz Generator (QQG) is a software that allows the user to practice F=ma problems (problems from a physics competition). At the home screen of the program, the user can choose one of four functions. First, the QQG allows the user to practice 25 random problems in 75 minutes (called Practice), just as the competition is. The QQG shows the image of the problem on the screen, and the user selects the button corresponding to the correct answer. After time is up, the user is able to review the answers and see the problems that he or she got wrong. At any time, the QQG allows the user to return to the home menu if he or she wants to stop. The second function is similar to the first; the user can practice random problems, but at his or her own pace (called Quick Quiz). Each problem has a timer that goes up, so the user can see how much time has elapsed while solving the problem, but the user can practice as many problems for however long he or she wishes. After solving an individual problem, the QQG will show the solution to that problem. The third function of the QQG is to allow users to add problems. The user will insert images for the problem and the solution, select an answer choice, select the problemâ€™s topic, which will then put the problem into the local problem database for further use. Finally, the QQG allows users to remove any problem he or she dislikes (for example, if a problem is incorrect).
